Deep Learning @MSU Dept. of Mechanics and Mathematics Course Materials


Edit (04/29/2019):

Gathering and uploading all the "course" materials would serve no purpose at this point. Sure, there are slides and code for eight lectures or so, but they are, quite frankly, subpar. 

However, I am not planning to delete this repository, but I want to keep it as a placeholder for any future course I will or will not want to devise and publish.
